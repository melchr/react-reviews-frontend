# SPITE HOUSE V2

This single page application was built on a Rails API backend [found here](https://github.com/melchr/react-reviews-backend).

Spite House is, simply put, a negative music review website. Reviews are created by yours truly, (also using the Faker gem in Rails), and future functionality will include a proper domain (spite-house.com), other user input as well as ability to comment.

# Technologies Used
